highlight-cov
===========

highlight lines based on test coverage info.

looks for a file at `./coverage/lcov.info` at file's path, and upwards.

To generate that file for js files take a look at [istanbul](https://www.npmjs.org/package/istanbul)

highlights won't be refreshed automatically, after a coverage recalculation toggle this plugin off/on.
